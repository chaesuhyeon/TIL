<h2>WEB</h2> 
      <p>The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) 
        is an information space where documents and
         other web resources are identified by Uniform 
         Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext 
         links, and can be accessed via the Internet.[1] 
         English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World
         ide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser 
         computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in 
         Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released 
         outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research 
         institutions starting in January 1991 and to the 
         general public on the Internet in August 1991
