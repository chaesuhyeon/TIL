      <h2>WEB</h2> 
      <p>The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) 
        is an information space where documents and
         other web resources are identified by Uniform 
         Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext 
         links, and can be accessed via the Internet.[1] 
         English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World
         ide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser 
         computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in 
         Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released 
         outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research 
         institutions starting in January 1991 and to the 
         general public on the Internet in August 1991

          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is 
          the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and 
          web applications.Web browsers receive HTML documents 
          from a web server or from local storage and 
          render them into multimedia web pages. 
          HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
          originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

          <p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
            With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as 
            interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. 
            It provides a means to create structured documents 
            by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
            paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
            HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
